0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
The getrusage function returns information about the resource usage of a process,
such as the amount of memory used and time spent executing user instructions.

2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
There are 16 members in a variable of type struct rusage.

3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, 
even though we’re not changing their contents?
A pointer to each one of them is passed to calculate(). If we pass them by value, 
it will be a waste of time and memory space.

4.  After the text file and the dictionary are loaded, the main() function reads the 
text character-by-character, and these characters are appended to the word. If the word has 
numbers, or it is too long, this word won’t be checked for misspellings. When the word 
index is greater than 0, the word is terminated and checked for misspellings, and
index is reset to zero. The whole process is repeated for the next word. 

5.  fgetc() reads character-by-character from a stream and keeps track of the number of chars.
fscanf() could cause problems if used to read in because words in that file will not always end 
with a space or line return. 
 
6.  The const specifies that these parameters' values are constant and tells the compiler 
to prevent us from modifying them.

7.  I used hash table to implement the spell-checker.  The SDBM Hash Function takes in a string value
and returns a non-negative integer value called a hash code that represents the hash array location
pointing to a linked list.  In a linked list, each node contains the string value and the address of 
the next node.
